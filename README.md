info-graphs, tools, etc., related to artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and other related fields. Each library has its own folder, along with its own
`README.md` file with installation and usage instructions.

## Libraries

### 1. Water

[Water](./convolutional/water) is a Python library designed to simplify the
process of building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It offers automatic
configuration of padding and stride, making it easier for users to create and
customize CNN architectures.
